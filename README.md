# Were They in the nWo?
Were They in the nWo is a website designed to provide an interactive means of basking in some classic 90's nostalgia. Dedicated to the group that "made wrestling cool", the intention of the site is to provide a fun quiz regarding membership of the eponymous stable to users.

Selection of the subject matter was two-fold; wrestling is currently experiencing a renaissance. New management in WWE has reignited the wrestling industry and many lapsed fans are returning to the product, as indicated by internet traffic and ticket sales. This makes the timing of such a website quite advantageous. Furthermore, many returning fans consider the era of the nWo to be the "peak" of wrestling as a whole. The intention of the website is to capitalise on this nostalgia by drawing traffic and to eventually grow the site to feature other features that hopefully convince new users to visit regularly.
